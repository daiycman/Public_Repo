# Welcome to the IycMan Tech Scripting and Lab Repository

My name is IycMan (IceMan) or Joe when we are plugged into the matrix. :bowtie:

This repository is designed to help fellow tech enthusiasts and IT professionals jumpstart their journey in scripting and building a home lab.
Whether you're a seasoned sysadmin, an aspiring DevOps engineer, or someone passionate about tinkering with tech, my hope is that you will find useful resources, scripts, and ideas to experiment with.

## What You Will Find Here

- Automation Scripts: Random scripts I have wrote over time for various environments
- Home Lab Guides: Step-by-step instructions on how to set up tools and tweaks I've made to help (of course with pictures and commands)
- Tech Tutorials: Bite Sized guides on quarks in tech. My biggest question when starting out was "WHERE AND HOW DO I FIND THAT"

## Why This Repo Exists

When I started in tech... I was lost. I didnt even know you could create a homelab. Then when I learned about creating my own environment... It was a struggle to find consistent data.
I would have to look all over the web for certain issues I was facing when figuring anything out. I hope to bring more consolidated plans to this Repo for everyone. I want to make the process easier by providing all of my pit falls so others can learn from my mistakes!
